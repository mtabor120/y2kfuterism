      <h2>Systems Design</h2>
      <img src="https://yourimagehost.com/path-to-systems-design.jpg" alt="Futuristic Systems Design">
      <p>Systems design involves creating the structure, architecture, and components of software systems to ensure efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. It allows developers to streamline processes, eliminate unnecessary components, and enhance security and user experience. Proper systems design enables software systems to be built quickly and efficiently while maintaining high standards for performance and reliability.</p>
      <blockquote>“System design enables developers to identify and eliminate unnecessary components and processes, create software systems quickly and easily, and improve the security, scalability, user experience, and maintenance of the software system” (GeeksforGeeks, 2022).</blockquote>

      <p>Information architecture determines how data is structured...</p>
      <blockquote>“Information architecture (IA) is a key aspect of UX design that focuses on organizing information, structuring websites and mobile apps, and helping users navigate them to find and process the information they need” (Morville, 2016).</blockquote>
